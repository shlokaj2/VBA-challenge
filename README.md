# VBA-challenge

This is what I have of the assignment. I was able to get the sheets for each year looped together and running properly. However, when I tried to put in the code for the calculations of the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume on there, everything somehow got messed up and nothing seems to work properly.
I will continue to work on it and resubmit it at a later time.
